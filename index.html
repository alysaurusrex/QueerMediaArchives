    <h2>A forever growing archive of queer media</h2>
    <h3>by queer people for queer people (and the squirrels that love them)</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="explanation">Our general definition of "queer media" for the application of this site is: <blockquote>Any form of visual media with at least one protagonist that identifies as queer.</blockquote></p>
    <br>
    <p>We believe that representation matters, so we organized this archive to make queer media easier to find and curate. Currently, users will be able to use filters to narrow down a search by media type, genre, and language. We are working on additional features to personalize the browsing experience.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What started as a handwritten list of queer media to consume, the Queer Media Archives grew to become a vast list of films, short films, tv shows, and web-series compiled to scratch the itch of "I want to watch something queer." While we knew this wouldn't be a weekend project, we were definitely surprised by the amount of queer media that exists in the world. The vast amount of titles means we realistically will not be able to consume every entry to confirm that each of them contain concrete queerness <em>and</em> don't exclusively 'press the bruise' of queerness. In an effort to reach the moving goalpost of 'completeness' for this archive, there is only so much research per title we can do before deciding to add or cut it. If you recognize a title that should not belong, please reach out so we can investigate it more thoroughly.</p>
    <br> 
    <p>The original goal for this archive was to include every known title and keep it updated with time, but we've run across some problematic titles that we have intentionally put at the bottom of the ever growing <em>To Be Entered</em> list. Recognizing that "problematic" can be subjective, we've reserved this adjective for entries that seem to ONLY harm the community in their portrayal of queerness. You will still find entries that could be labeled 'problematic' as well as titles that are hard to watch. We're working on features that will facilitate more informed decisions for our users. </p>
    <br>
    <p>This site is currently under construction. Changes are made live, so check back periodically as we grow. Until our 'search' feature is active, please use ctrl F to find specific titles. Titles are entered in their native language when applicable. Feel free to contact us with media titles you don't see listed and any feedback on your experience navigating the card catalogue as we get ourselves settled. URL at gmail for now. Thank you for existing. We hope you find what you're looking for &#x2764.</p>
